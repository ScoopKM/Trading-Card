			<p class="description">Cheeseburger the Magnificent likes Cheeseburgers, hence her name. She also goes by Cheeseburger for short.
				 Cheeseburger orignially looked like a cute sausage roll, when she was first found, but has since started exercising and slimmed down.
				 Cheeseburger enjoys going on walks, loving on people, and loves parties. Cheeseburger is always at her owner's parties, and
				 loves to dress up in her burger costume to greet every guest, with bunches of kisses.
